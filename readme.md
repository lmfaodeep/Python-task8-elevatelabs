This is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python. It interacts with users through the command line using predefined responses and basic if-elif-else logic. The chatbot can respond to greetings, simple questions, and exit commands. It's ideal for beginners to understand how conditional statements and input/output loops work in Python.
It only works on what you input as an if else statement.
